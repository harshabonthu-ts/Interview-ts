# Back-end Interview Challenge Overview

This github repository is setup as a starting point for candidates to display their knowledge of
C# and their ability to leverage this technology to craft API endpoints.

Candidate is encouraged to go into detail with explanations about the why, how, and what
in regards to the steps they're taking (or would take if given more time) when completing this
task.

There might not be a significant amount of time to complete every potential challenge that
arises, and that's fine. The goal is to be able to see the candidates thought process and 
general knowledge while working through the issues presented in this project.
